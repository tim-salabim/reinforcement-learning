Specifically, write a function, named step, which takes as input a state s (dealer’s first card 1–10 and the player’s sum 1–21), and an action a (hit or stick), and returns a sample of the next state s’ (which may be terminal if the game is finished) and reward r. We will be using this environment for model-free reinforcement learning, and you should not explicitly represent the transition matrix for the MDP. There is no discounting (γ = 1). You should treat the dealer’s moves as part of the environment, i.e. calling step with a stick action will play out the dealer’s cards and return the final reward and terminal state.\n\n\n\n\nstep = function(\n    s = c(drawCard(\"black\"), drawCard(\"black\"))\n    , a = c(\"hit\", \"stick\")\n) {\n  a = match.arg(a)\n  r = 0\n  # player hits - add next card\n  if (a == \"hit\") {\n    s[2] = sum(hit(s[2]))\n    if (s[2] &lt; 1 || s[2] &gt; 21) {\n      r = -1\n    }\n    return(\n      list(\n        s = s\n        , r = r\n      )\n    )\n  }\n  \n  # player sticks - play out game\n  if (a == \"stick\") {\n    if (s[1] &gt;= 17) {\n      if (s[1] &lt; 1 || s[1] &gt; 21) {\n        r = 1\n      } else if (s[2] &gt; s[1]) {\n        r = 1\n      } else if (s[1] &gt; s[2]) {\n        r = -1\n      }\n      return(\n        list(\n          s = s\n          , r = r\n        )\n      )\n    } else {\n      s[1] = sum(hit(s[1]))\n      s = step(s, \"stick\")\n      return(s)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ns1 = step(a = \"hit\")\ns1\n\n$s\n[1] 5 0\n\n$r\n[1] -1\n\ns2 = step(s1$s, \"hit\")\nstep(s2$s, \"stick\")\n\n$s\n[1] 17  7\n\n$r\n[1] -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef step(s, a):\n  r = 0\n  return {\"s\": s, \"r\": r}\n\nstep([12, 12], \"hit\")\n\n{'s': [12, 12], 'r': 0}"
