The dealer always sticks on any sum of 17 or greater, and hits otherwise. If the dealer goes bust, then the player wins; otherwise, the outcome – win (reward +1), lose (reward -1), or draw (reward 0) – is the player with the largest sum.\n\n\n\n\nPart 1 of the Easy21 Assignment:\n\nYou should write an environment that implements the game Easy21. Specifically, write a function, named \\(step\\), which takes as input a state \\(s\\) (dealer’s first card 1–10 and the player’s sum 1–21), and an action \\(a\\) (hit or stick), and returns a sample of the next state \\(s'\\) (which may be terminal if the game is finished) and reward \\(r\\). We will be using this environment for model-free reinforcement learning, and you should not explicitly represent the transition matrix for the MDP. There is no discounting (\\(\\gamma = 1\\)). You should treat the dealer’s moves as part of the environment, i.e. calling \\(step\\) with a stick action will play out the dealer’s cards and return the final reward and terminal state.\n\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nstep = function(\n    s = c(drawCard(\"black\"), drawCard(\"black\"))\n    , a = c(\"hit\", \"stick\")\n) {\n  a = match.arg(a)\n  r = 0\n  t = FALSE\n  # player hits - add next card\n  if (a == \"hit\") {\n    s[2] = sum(hit(s[2]))\n    if (s[2] &lt; 1 || s[2] &gt; 21) {\n      r = -1\n      t = TRUE\n    }\n    return(\n      list(\n        s = s\n        , r = r\n        , terminated = t\n      )\n    )\n  }\n  \n  # player sticks - play out game\n  if (a == \"stick\") {\n    if (s[1] &gt;= 17) {\n      if (s[1] &lt; 1 || s[1] &gt; 21) {\n        r = 1\n      } else if (s[2] &gt; s[1]) {\n        r = 1\n      } else if (s[1] &gt; s[2]) {\n        r = -1\n      }\n      return(\n        list(\n          s = s\n          , r = r\n          , terminated = TRUE\n        )\n      )\n    } else {\n      s[1] = sum(hit(s[1]))\n      s = step(s, \"stick\")\n      return(s)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n# play first card and hit\ns1 = step(a = \"hit\")\ns1\n\n$s\n[1]  6 16\n\n$r\n[1] 0\n\n$terminated\n[1] FALSE\n\n# hit one more time then stick and let dealer play out\ns2 = step(s1$s, \"hit\")\nstep(s2$s, \"stick\")\n\n$s\n[1] 17 14\n\n$r\n[1] -1\n\n$terminated\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\ndef step(s, a):\n  r = 0\n  \n  if a == \"hit\":\n    s[1] = sum(hit(s[1]))\n    \n    if s[1] &lt; 1 or s[1] &gt; 21:\n      r = -1\n    \n    return {\"s\": s, \"r\": r}\n  \n  if a == \"stick\":\n    if s[0] &gt;= 17:\n      if s[0] &lt; 1 or s[0] &gt; 21:\n        r = 1\n      elif s[1] &gt; s[0]:\n        r = 1\n      elif s[0] &gt; s[1]:\n        r = -1\n        \n      return {\"s\": s, \"r\": r}\n  \n    else:\n      s[0] = sum(hit(s[0]))\n      s = step(s, \"stick\")\n      return s\n\n# play first card and hit\ns1 = step(s = [drawCard(\"black\"), drawCard(\"black\")], a = \"hit\")\ns1\n\n{'s': [4, 9], 'r': 0}\n\n# hit one more time then stick and let dealer play out\ns2 = step(s1[\"s\"], \"hit\")\nstep(s2[\"s\"], \"stick\")\n\n{'s': [23, 15], 'r': 1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Monte-Carlo control to Easy21. Initialise the value function to zero. Use a time-varying scalar step-size of \\(\\alpha_{t} = 1/N(s_{t}, a_{t})\\) and an \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy exploration strategy with \\(\\epsilon_{t} = N_{0}/(N_{0} + N(s_{t}))\\), where \\(N_{0} = 100\\) is a constant, \\(N(s)\\) is the number of times that state s has been visited, and \\(N(s, a)\\) is the number of times that action \\(a\\) has been selected from state \\(s\\). Feel free to choose an alternative value for \\(N_{0}\\), if it helps producing better results. Plot the optimal value function \\(V^{∗} (s) = max_{a} Q^{∗} (s, a)\\) using similar axes to the following figure taken from Sutton and Barto’s Blackjack example.\n\n\n\n\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nalpha = function(Na) {\n  1 / Na\n}\n\nepsilon = function(Ns, N0 = 100) {\n  N0 / (N0 + Ns)\n}\n\ngreedyAction = function(actions, values) {\n  if (length(actions) == 1) {\n    return(actions)\n  }\n  if (length(values) == 0 || Reduce(identical, values)) {\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n  actions[which.max(values)]\n}\n  \nchooseAction = function(epsilon, greedy_action = NULL) {\n  action = sample(c(\"hit\", \"stick\"), 1)\n  if (!is.null(greedy_action)) {\n    action = sample(\n      c(greedy_action, action)\n      , 1\n      , prob = c(max(0, 1 - epsilon), epsilon)\n    )\n  }\n  return(action)\n}\n\nmcUpdate = function(value, reward, Ns, alpha) {\n  value + alpha * (reward - value)# / Ns\n}\n\n# isPlayable = function(s) {\n#   s[1] &lt;= 10 & !(any(s &lt; 1) || any(s &gt; 21))\n# }"
