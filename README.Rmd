## About

This is a place to collect all things relevant to David Silver's [Reinforcement Learning course](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)

It is especially intended to document code development for the [Easy21](https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Easy21-Johannes.pdf) assingment.
